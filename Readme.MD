# Social App

## Definition
The Social App is an application to create, comment and like posts of your friends and family:
 - Login & Register a user
 - Edit user information
 - Profile page

## App Details
- This app is written in `Spring Boot`. It uses `Spring Security` for authentication. Authentication is with JWT 
  tokens.
- The backend uses `Spring Data JPA` with `Liquibase` and it uses a `MySQL` database.
- Input data is automatically validated with `Hibernate validator` and custom validations are included.
- Exports metrics using `Spring Actuator`.
- The `frontend` is built with `Angular`.
- `Gradle` manages the `Node.js` environment for the `frontend` part.
- The final `jar` file is a `fat jar` and `Gradle` embeds the generated `html`, `css` and `js` files from the `vite 
build`.
- The `fat jar` is bundled in a `docker image` and the image is published to `Github` packages with `Github Actions`.
- Included `CI/CD` using `Github Actions`.
